# LibraryManagement

The library management system is intended at providing a seamless solution for all library management needs.
It's functions cover activities like adding a book record, keeping reocords of borrowing and returning of books and viewing all the available books

The development of the system was the result of a process that found adherence to TDD rules and SOLID Principles
For each functional aspect , a test case was designed , based on the test scenarios, functions were developed in a manner which sufficiently fulfilled the test needs. The approach was incremental in nature. Each function in the program performs a peculiar task.

I have made usage of MagicMock objects to simulate database interactions.

The sole aim was to isolate testing environment and appropriate logic development
